Chrome extesion

This project is a Chrome extension that displays the live prices of various cryptocurrencies when called upon. This extension utilizes data from cryptocurrency exchanges and updates in real-time to provide users with up-to-date information about the current market prices of their favorite digital assets.

This project requires knowledge of web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as an understanding of how to retrieve and parse data from external APIs.

By building this extension, I have created a useful tool for cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts who want to stay informed about the latest market trends and make informed investment decisions. My extension can also be a valuable learning experience, as you explore the intricacies of cryptocurrency pricing and market dynamics.
